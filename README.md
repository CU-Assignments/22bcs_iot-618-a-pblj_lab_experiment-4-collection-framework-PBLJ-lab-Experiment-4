## ðŸ“Œ Experiment 2.2: Autoboxing, Serialization, and File Handling  

| Program | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **[Sum Calculation with Autoboxing](src/Experiment2_2/SumAutoboxing.java)** | Uses autoboxing/unboxing to calculate the sum of a list of integers and parse strings into wrapper classes. |
| **[Student Serialization](src/Experiment2_2/StudentSerialization.java)** | Serializes and deserializes a `Student` object. |
| **[Employee File Management](src/Experiment2_2/EmployeeFileManager.java)** | A menu-driven program to add, display, and store employee details in a file. |

## ðŸ“Œ Experiment 2.3: Lambda Expressions and Streams  

| Program | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **[Employee Sorting](src/Experiment2_3/EmployeeSorting.java)** | Uses lambda expressions to sort employees by name, age, and salary. |
| **[Student Filtering](src/Experiment2_3/StudentFiltering.java)** | Filters students scoring above 75%, sorts them by marks, and displays names using streams. |
| **[Product Processing](src/Experiment2_3/ProductProcessing.java)** | Processes a large dataset of products, groups them by category, finds the most expensive product, and calculates the average price using streams. |

## ðŸ“Œ Experiment 2.4: JDBC and MVC Architecture  

| Program | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **[MySQL Database Connection](src/Experiment2_4/DatabaseConnection.java)** | Connects to a MySQL database, retrieves, and displays records from an `Employee` table. |
| **[Product CRUD Operations](src/Experiment2_4/ProductCRUD.java)** | Performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a `Product` table with transaction handling. |
| **[Student Management System (MVC)](src/Experiment2_4/StudentManagement.java)** | Implements an MVC-based system with CRUD operations for student data using JDBC. |
