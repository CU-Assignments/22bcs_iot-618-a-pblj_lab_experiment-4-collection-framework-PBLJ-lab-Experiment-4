## Experiment 2.1: Core Java Concepts  

| Program | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **[Employee Management System](EmployeeManagement.java)** | Implements an `ArrayList` to store employee details (ID, Name, Salary). Supports add, update, remove, and search functionalities. |
| **[Card Collection System](CardCollection.java)** | Uses the `Collection` interface to store and retrieve cards by symbol. |
| **[Ticket Booking System](TicketBooking.java)** | Ensures synchronized seat booking with thread priorities to simulate VIP bookings. |

## Experiment 2.2: Autoboxing, Serialization, and File Handling  

| Program | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **[Sum Calculation with Autoboxing](SumAutoboxing.java)** | Uses autoboxing/unboxing to calculate the sum of a list of integers and parse strings into wrapper classes. |
| **[Student Serialization](StudentSerialization.java)** | Serializes and deserializes a `Student` object. |
| **[Employee File Management](EmployeeFileManager.java)** | A menu-driven program to add, display, and store employee details in a file. |

## Experiment 2.3: Lambda Expressions and Streams  

| Program | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **[Employee Sorting](EmployeeSorting.java)** | Uses lambda expressions to sort employees by name, age, and salary. |
| **[Student Filtering](StudentFiltering.java)** | Filters students scoring above 75%, sorts them by marks, and displays names using streams. |
| **[Product Processing](ProductProcessing.java)** | Processes a large dataset of products, groups them by category, and finds the most expensive product using streams. |
